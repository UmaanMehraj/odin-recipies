    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This heaven on earth cake is an easy summer no-bake dessert that can be made up to 2 days ahead. Airy angel food
        cakecubes are layered with cherry pie filling and rich vanilla pudding, then topped with swirls of whipped
        topping and more cherry filling.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> <em>One</em> (14 ounce) purchased angel food cake, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
        <li><em>One</em> (21 ounce) can cherry pie filling, divided</li>
        <li><em>One</em> (3.4 ounce) package vanilla instant pudding mix and pie filling (such as Jell-OÂ®)</li>
        <li><em>One</em> 1/2 cups whole milk or half-and-half</li>
        <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
        <li><em>One</em> (8 ounce) container frozen whipped topping, thawed</li>
        <li>sliced almonds (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place half of angel food cake pieces in the bottom of a deep 8-x-8-inch or 9x9-inch baking dish in an even
            layer. Spread
            1 cup cherry pie filling over top of cake. Top with remaining cake pieces in an even layer.</li>
        <li>Whisk together vanilla pudding mix, whole milk, and sour cream in a large bowl until slightly thickened and
            smooth,
            about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Pour pudding mix over top of cake and spread evenly.</li>
        <li>Spread thawed whipped topping over pudding layer. Dot with remaining 1 cup cherry pie filling. Using a
            toothpick or
            spoon, swoop and swirl pie filling into the whipped topping. Refrigerate, uncovered, for at least 8 hours or
            up to 12
            hours. Garnish with sliced almonds</li>
